This is a Discord bot, named after Seraphine, the character from League of Legends.

She can respond to certain phrases, greetings, or commands (using her chat prefix). Her list of commands can be brought up in Discord using the "help" command. Her token is left empty. This needs to be filled in with a Discord bot token created in the Discord Developer page. To run Seraphine, use the .bat file
